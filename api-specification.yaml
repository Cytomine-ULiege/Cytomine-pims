      description: |
        Intensity in the original image used as minimum intensity (black) to create the response.
        As a consequence, original image intensities lower than this value will be black in the response.

        Maximum allowed value depends on image pixel type and is equal to `2 * pow(pixel type)`.

        Minimum intensity is closely related to the concepts of brightness and contrast.
        Brightness is the visual perception of reflected light while contrast is the separation
        of the lightest and darkest parts of an image. A minimum intensity increase leads to:
        * a brightness decrease, which refers to an image's decreased luminance.
        * a contrast increase, which darken shadows and lighten highlights.

        Expected format is an array of size:
        * 1 to apply the minimum intensity to all channels
        * equals to the number of channels used to render the response in order to apply a minimum intensity per channel

        Enumeration supported values:
        * `AUTO_IMAGE` - If image pixel type uses 8 bits, `min_intensity=0`. Otherwise, the behavior is `STRETCH_IMAGE`.
        * `AUTO_PLANE` - If image pixel type uses 8 bits, `min_intensity=0`. Otherwise, the behavior is `STRETCH_PLANE`.
        * `STRETCH_IMAGE` - Set `min_intensity` to lowest intensity in the original image, for each channel.
        * `STRETCH_PLANE` - Set `min_intensity` to lowest intensity in the set of planes, for each channel.

        Intensity in the original image used as maximum intensity (white) to create the response.
        As a consequence, original image intensities greater than this value will be white in the response.

        Maximum allowed value depends on image pixel type and is equal to `2 * pow(pixel type)`.

        Maximum intensity is closely related to the concepts of brightness and contrast.
        Brightness is the visual perception of reflected light while contrast is the separation
        of the lightest and darkest parts of an image. A maximum intensity increase leads to:
        * a brightness decrease, which refers to an image's decreased luminance.
        * a contrast decrease, which darken highlights and lighten shadows.

        Expected format is an array of size:
        * 1 to apply the maximum intensity to all channels
        * equals to the number of channels used to render the response in order to apply a maximum intensity per channel

        Enumeration supported values:
        * `AUTO_IMAGE` - If image pixel type uses 8 bits, `max_intensity=255`. Otherwise, the behavior is
        `STRETCH_IMAGE`.
        * `AUTO_PLANE` - If image pixel type uses 8 bits, `max_intensity=255`. Otherwise, the behavior is
        `STRETCH_PLANE`.
        * `STRETCH_IMAGE` - Set `max_intensity` to greatest intensity in the original image, for each channel.
        * `STRETCH_PLANE` - Set `max_intensity` to greatest intensity in the set of planes, for each channel.
